# COCO: COmparing Continuous Optimizers  #
---

COCO (COmparing Continuous Optimizers) is a platform for systematic and sound comparisons of real-parameter global optimizers. 
COCO provides benchmark function testbeds, experimentation templates which are easy to parallelize, and tools for processing and 
visualizing data generated by one or several optimizers. The COCO platform has been used for the
[Black-Box-Optimization-Benchmarking (BBOB) workshops](http://numbbo.github.io/workshops/) that took place during the GECCO
conference in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015-2019, and in 2021. It was also used at the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation
(CEC'2015) in Sendai, Japan.

The COCO experiment source code has been rewritten in the years 2014-2015 and the current production code is available on our
[COCO github page](https://github.com/numbbo/coco). The old code is still available [here](oldcode/bboball15.03.tar.gz)
 and shall be used for experiments on the noisy test suite until this test suite will be available in the new code as well. 



## ! Webpage currently under construction ! ##
Due to the shutdown of our old COCO page at coco.gforge.inria.fr, we are going to create a new and better version here. Stay tuned for all
information coming back shortly. In the meantime, please consider getting information from the sources below. Especially
in the development branch of the main [COCO code page](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/tree/development), you will find the most
updated links to code and documentation.
If you want to visit the old COCO webpage, please use a static version on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504150230/https://coco.gforge.inria.fr/).
