The COCO/NumBBO experiments interface {#mainpage}
=====================================

<a href="https://github.com/numbbo/numbbo">COCO (COmparing Continuous Optimisers)</a> is a platform 
for systematic and sound comparisons of real-parameter global optimisers mainly developed within the 
<a href="http://numbbo.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php">NumBBO project</a>. COCO provides benchmark function 
testbeds, experimentation templates which are easy to parallelize, and tools for processing and 
visualizing data generated by one or several optimizers.

### Remplementation of COCO in ANSI C

In order to allow for easier maintenance and further extensions of the COCO platform, it was rewritten
entirely from 2014 till 2016. Now, a single implementation in ANSI C (aka C89) is used and called from
the other languages to conduct the experiments. This documentation of the COCO C code serves therefore
as the basic reference for:
 - How to conduct benchmarking experiments in C
 - How to write new test functions and combine them into test suites
 - How to write additional performance indicators and logging functionality

### Pointers to the source code and other documentation
