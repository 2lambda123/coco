Two Interpretation Of Instances
================================

Different instances of each function are used when collecting the number of function evaluations needed to reach a target for a given function. Those instances correspond to different instantiations of the (random) transformations applied to the raw functions behind the construction of the test functions. (A transformation can be a random rotation of the search space, ...)

We interpret the different instances in two different manner:

Pure repetition
***************

First of all, we interpret the different instances as if they are just a repetition of the same function. In this case we consider the run length collected on the different instances (for a given function and target) as independent identically distributed random variables. This interpretation is important for our construction of the simulated run-length and the computation of the ERT performance measure.


Instances are actually different

Simulated runlengths don't make sense in this interpretation
