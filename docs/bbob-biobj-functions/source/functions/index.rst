The ``bbob-biobj`` Test Functions and Their Properties
======================================================

will go here:

Give for each function:
- its definition and relation to the ``bbob`` test suite (function ids for example)
- known ideal and nadir point
- plots of Pareto set and Pareto front of archive
- potentially the outcomes of example algorithms
- plots (in objective space) of randomly samples search points
- potentially function value distributions along cuts through the search space
