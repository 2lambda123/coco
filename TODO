Error catching:
*Bug! Though the new fgeneric output is read without problems.
** MaxEvals should be defined by index files ?
** best worst, ... should be defined by .dat files?
** hdat -> when f-fopt = 0 -> bug in the results displayed.
*When given a wrong path, nothing happens...
*Problem with demo (is not working): no possibility of shorter demo due to writeTable2. It should try and take as input a list of arrays.
*problem with the tables: too many floats to handle -> not more than 12 it seems.
*tables are hard to read: columns do not have all the same width
*sign missing for function values in the tables!

Feature missing:
*Deal with archive file -> not file-like object for zipfile module in python 2.5.2
*synchronize the caption of the data profiles with information from the post processing?
*Put a separation line in the table between function evaluations and function values
*Have the number of solved functions appear on the data profile graph
*Have SP1 on the data profile graph as well?
*Compute the entropy based on the comment line in the info file?
*Compare results from different algorithms!
*generate data for the run length distrib figure, ppfig and pptex not in pproc (to make pprldistr pptex and ppfig modules self-consistent)
*Play with the fontsize (smaller titles, larger ticks).
*Move the figures and make them larger.

Misc.
*Make sure that anyone could produce a fig, table or data profile for every dimensions, functions they want.
*documentation
*error testing
*Explicit demo post processing.
*make tab only faster: it doesn't need to process everything...
*Problem with some fonts missing for tex compilation.
*max. FEvals appearing in the tables is not the one set for the experiment but
an empirical value (measured).
*Write somewhere the result of the discussion about maxEvals.
*Caption of the tables is too large!
*Change mention of data profile graph to run length graph.
*Prepare for vertical aligning!


Profiling:
*>80% of time spent on pproc.split

SOLVED:
*Short titles for the figures
*Problem with reading the data: the last line was left unread
*Problem with the median that was defined though it was not.
*Problem with Gtk/gdk over ssh (import matplotlib) -> ssh -X
*delete tex before writing in at the launch of the post processing... are the files written in again? -> They are not so the output tex files are simply overwritten.
*last figures: not spanned over the width of the page -> put a tabular.
*increased font size for figure -> parameter in __init__.py
*Change ticks labels font size -> parameter in __init__.py
*Visible Symbol for the last function value reached -> Make more visible?
*F_t in the tables instead of f_t (cf experimentation.pdf ยง6.4)
*BUG: demo.py when the toydata folder does not exist -> catch when args is empty.
*function values in italics missing -> pproc.py has to return in arrayTab the right things.
