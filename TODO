Error catching:
*When given a wrong path, nothing happens...
*Problem with Gtk/gdk over ssh (import matplotlib) -> ssh -X
*Problem with demo (is not working): no possibility of shorter demo due to writeTable2. It should try and take as input a list of arrays.
*delete tex before writing in at the launch of the post processing... are the files written in again?
*problem with the tables: too many floats to handle...
*last figures: not spanned over the width of the page.

Feature missing:
*function values in italics missing
*increased font size
*Visible Symbol for the last function value reached
*Deal with archive file.

Misc.
*documentation
*error testing
*Explicit demo post processing.
*make tab only faster: it doesn't need to process everything...
